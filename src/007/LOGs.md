# Creating JavaScript Functions (LOGs)

*At the end of this lesson, you should be able to...*

- [ ] Identify and distinguish the various ways to declare a function
  - *See this [Chat GPT discussion](https://chat.openai.com/share/da57cfba-9ece-4c5d-a48b-66e374211c9c) for an explanation.*
- [ ] Describe the essential parts of a function declaration
  - A function declaration must have a parameter list (even if it is empty) and a function body (even if it is empty). The other parts will depend on the way the function is being declared.
- [ ] Describe what is meant by a **function signature**
  - Typically, a function signature is the combination of the name of the function and its parameter list.
- [ ] Describe what is meant by the term **function body**
- [ ] Define the term [**Block-statement**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block)
- [ ] Define the term **parameter**
- [ ] Define the term **argument**
- [ ] Define the term **scope**
- [ ] Distinguish between local scope and global scope
- [ ] Describe how local scope "hides" a variable declared inside a function
- [ ] Define the term **lifetime**
- [ ] Distinguish between the lifetime of a variable and the scope of a variable
  - The difference between the lifetime of a variable and the scope of a variable is that the lifetime of a variable is how long it exists in memory, whereas the scope of a variable is where it can be accessed in the code.
- [ ] Discuss some of the peculiarities of calling functions in JavaScript as compared to other languages such as C#
- [ ] Create functions that return a value
- [ ] Create functions that don't return a value
- [ ] Display a function in the developer tool's console window
- [ ] Explain the concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript
- [ ] Explain the benefits of declaring functions as constants in JavaScript
  - When you make your variable a constant (as in `const myFunction = function() { ... }`), you are making it read-only. This means that you can't accidentally overwrite it later in your code.
- [ ] Describe what is meant by the term "refactoring"
  - Taking code that already works and "cleaning it up" to make it more readable, more efficient, and/or more maintainable. This does not change the functionality of the code (it should still do the same job).
